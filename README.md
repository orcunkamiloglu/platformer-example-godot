# platformer-example-godot
It's a sample project in the Godot.

I created a game to learn game development, and it was my first step in this field. 
Along the way, I discovered how amazing game development is and now I want to create more games in the future.

Thanks for guidinance for this trip. [@NULLGameDev](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_DV_XlyV-JXmAjUjg68ROg)
